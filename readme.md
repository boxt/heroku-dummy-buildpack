# Heroku Dummy Buildpack

This is a dummy buildpack for Heroku. Heroku requires at least one buildpack to be set for an application even if it's not actually used. This buildpack serves as a placeholder primarily for scheduling Heroku dynos to run at regular intervals using the Heroku Scheduler add-on.
